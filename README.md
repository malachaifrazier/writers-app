## Spring

rails5-starter-app uses [spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) by default.
It makes Rails applications load faster, but it might introduce confusing issues around stale code not being refreshed.
If you think your application is running old code, run `spring stop`.
And if you'd rather not use spring, add `DISABLE_SPRING=1` to your login file.

## Dependencies

rails5-starter-app requires the latest version of Ruby.

Some gems included in rails5-starter-app have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with rails5-starter-app.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
